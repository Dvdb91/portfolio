            <p>Hi, I‘m Olivia, a graphic designer from Switzerland</p>

            <p>My longing desire to design stems from my affinity for order and
            geometry, as well as my strong visual and spacial thinking. Due to
            my attention to detail, I always look for inspiration outside of design
            and I strive to bring a sense of simplicity, clarity, authenticity
            and appropriateness to every project. I am very passionate about
            my work and driven to satisfy my clients.</p>

            <p>I’m raised by the amazing Blitz&Donner team, starting as an
            intern, working part time as a graphic designer during my studies
            and working full time with them, after successfully completing
            my Bachelor of Arts in Visual Communication. Within those
            exciting five years, I began to understand the importance of working
            interdisciplinarily on numerous channels and learned the beauty
            of clear and solid communication. I developed a belief in design
            that is more than just a empty wrap, but understands the clients
            best interests and represents them accordingly.</p>

            <p>I have the need to constantly evolve and advance my skill set, and
            alongside my main discipline of print design and branding, I have
            done work in photography, illustration, animation, web design,
            typography, video-production and texting. I believe in working
            hard, sitting up straight, embracing the unexpected and being
            punctual, but most of all I believe in the power of open, honest
            communication, fostering relationships and having a bit of fun
            along the way. At the end of the day, I just want to make great things with
            great people.</p>

            <p>I am currently based in Egypt where I work and live with my favourite
            Belgian person. In my spare time I am a Dive Instructor,
            and if I had a superpower, it would be breathing underwater. I
            love loud music and literally reducing my home to a backback
            from time to time. Brunch is definitely my favourite meal of the
            day – with a book or friends by my side.</p>
            
            <p>Right now, I’m looking for new projects and cooperations.
            Want to have a coffee? Cool! Contact me.</p>
